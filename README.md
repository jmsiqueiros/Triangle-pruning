Triangle-pruning
================

Code and materials for network pruning by weakest edge elimination in each triangle of the network. Edge elimination might be absolute (eliminates the weakest edge) or threshold dependent (eliminate an edge below or above a threshold). This is an implementation of the DPI pruning (MI) methods for infered networks applyied to real networks.
